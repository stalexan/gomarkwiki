  the syntactic category of that phrase."

# Style Guides
* "Strunk and White, for all their intuitive feel for style, had a tenuous grasp of grammar." (p 14)
* "the orthodox stylebooks are ill equipped to deal with an inescapable fact
  about language: it changes over time." (p 15)
* "My discomfort with the classic style manuals has convinced me that we need
  a writing guide for the twenty-first century. It’s not that I have the
  desire, to say nothing of the ability, to supplant The Elements of Style.
  Writers can profit by reading more than one style guide, and much of Strunk
  and White (as it is commonly called) is as timeless as it is charming." (p 18)

# Chapter 4: The Web, The Tree, and The String — __Understanding Syntax__ Can Help a Writer Avoid Ungrammatical, Convoluted, and Misleading Prose <span id=ch04 />
* Mastery of grammar is required for good writing (p 104):
> __[L]iterate people should know how to think about grammar.__ People already
> know how to use grammar, of course; they’ve been doing it since they were
> two. But __the unconscious mastery of language that is our birthright as
> humans is not enough to allow us to write good sentences.__
* Grammar is fascinating and is the "original sharing app" (p 105):
> [G]rammar is a fascinating subject in its own right, at least when it is
> properly explained...It should be thought of...as one of the extraordinary
> adaptations in the living world: our species’ solution to the problem of
> getting complicated thoughts from one head into another. Thinking of grammar
> as the original sharing app makes it much more interesting and much more
> useful. By understanding how the various features of grammar are designed to
> make sharing possible, we can put them to use in writing more clearly,
> correctly, and gracefully.
* Syntax as a tree of phrases (p 109-111):
> To understand how syntax works, it helps to visualize the ordering of
> strings-within-strings by drawing them at the ends of the branches of an
> upside-down tree...
>
> __Syntax...is an app that uses a tree of phrases to translate a web of
> thoughts into a string of words.__
>
> The tree, of course, is only a metaphor. What it captures is that adjacent
> words are grouped into phrases, that the phrases are embedded inside larger
> phrases, and that the arrangement of words and phrases may be used to recover
> the relationships among the characters in the speaker’s mind. A tree is
> simply an easy way to display that design on a page. The design could just as
> accurately be shown with a series of braces and brackets, or with a Venn
> diagram...Regardless of the notation, appreciating the engineering design
> behind a sentence—a linear ordering of phrases which conveys a gnarly network
> of ideas—is the key to understanding what you are trying to accomplish when
> you compose a sentence.
* "[A] writer must constantly reconcile the two sides of word order: a code for
  information, and a sequence of mental events." (p 111)
* "These are the “parts of speech” that should be familiar even to people who
  were educated after the 1960s:"
  * [Noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun)
  * [Verb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb)
  * [Preposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preposition_and_postposition) (e.g. in, around, underneath, before, until)
  * [Adjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective)
  * [Adverb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverb)
  * [Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_(grammar)) and
    [determiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determiner) (e.g. the, a, some,
    this, that, many, one, two, three)
  * [Coordinators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_(grammar)#Coordinating_conjunctions) (e.g. and, or, nor, but, yet, so).
  * [Subordinators]() (e.g. that, whether, if, to)
* The __phrase head__ (p 112-3):
> Let's zoom in on one of the words, married. Together with its grammatical
> category, verb...its __grammatical function__, in this case, head.
> A grammatical function identifies not what a word is in the language but what
> it does in that particular sentence: how it combines with the other words to
> determine the sentence’s meaning. The “head” of a phrase is the little nugget
> which stands for the whole phrase. It determines the core of the phrase’s meaning.
>
> __The “head” of a phrase__ is the little nugget which stands for the whole
> phrase. It determines the core of the phrase’s meaning...  It also determines
> the grammatical category of the phrase: in this case it is a verb phrase,
> a phrase built around a verb...No matter how much stuff is packed into the
> verb phrase...it can be inserted into the same position in the sentence as
> the phrase consisting solely of the verb married. This is true of the other
> kinds of phrases as well: the noun phrase the king of Thebes is built around
> the head noun king, it refers to an example of a king, and it can go wherever
> the simpler phrase the king can go.
* Grammatical categories and grammatical functions (p 115):
> Modern grammatical theories (like the one in The Cambridge Grammar of the
> English Language, which I use in this book) __distinguish grammatical
> categories like noun and verb from grammatical functions__ like subject,
> object, head, and modifier. And they distinguish both of these from semantic
> categories and roles like action, physical object, possessor, doer, and
> done-to, which refer to what the referents of the words are doing in the
> world. Traditional grammars tend to run the three concepts together. 
>
> As a child I was taught, for example, that the words soap in soap flakes and
> that in that boy were adjectives, because they modify nouns. But this
> confuses the grammatical category “adjective” with the grammatical function
> “modifier.” __There’s no need to wave a magic wand over the noun soap and
> transmute it into an adjective just because of what it’s doing in this
> phrase. It’s simpler to say that sometimes a noun can modify another noun.__
* Modern grammar requires keeping an open mind versus using traditional pigeonholes (p 117):
> __More generally, it’s essential to keep an open mind about how to diagram
> a sentence rather than assuming that everything you need to know about
> grammar was figured out before you were born.__ Categories, functions, and
> meanings have to be ascertained empirically, by running little experiments
> such as substituting a phrase whose category you don’t know for one you do
> know and seeing whether the sentence still works. Based on these
> mini-experiments, __modern grammarians have sorted words into grammatical
> categories that sometimes differ from the traditional pigeonholes__.
* Trees create cognitive load (p 118):
> Trees are what give language its power to communicate the links between
> ideas rather than just dumping the ideas in the reader’s lap. But they come
> at a cost, which is the extra load they impose on memory. It takes cognitive
> effort to build and maintain all those invisible branches, and it’s easy for
> reader and writer alike to backslide into treating a sentence as just one
> damn word after another.
* Be aware of trees while writing (p 134):
> "Though tree-awareness can help a writer avoid errors (and, as we shall see,
> help him make life easy for his readers), I am not suggesting that you
> literally diagram your sentences...it’s the more ethereal sensation of
> apprehending how words are grouped in phrases and zooming in on the heads of
> those phrases while ignoring the rest of the clutter.
* Needless words are common (p 136):
> Once you set yourself the task of identifying __needless words__, it’s
> surprising how many you can find.
* Although, needless words can sometimes be useful (p 139):
> The advice to omit needless words should not be confused with the
> puritanical edict that all writers must pare every sentence down to the
> shortest, leanest, most abstemious version possible. Even writers who prize
> clarity don’t do this. That’s because the difficulty of a sentence depends
> not just on its word count but on its geometry. __Good writers often use very
> long sentences, and they garnish them with words that are, strictly speaking,
> needless. But they get away with it by arranging the words so that a reader
> can absorb them a phrase at a time, each phrase conveying a chunk of
> conceptual structure.__
* Right-branching trees are easier to understand since a reader can unpack meaning as they go (p 140):
> __Even when the sentence structure gets more complicated, a reader can handle
> the tree, because its geometry is mostly right-branching. In
> a right-branching tree__, the most complicated phrase inside a bigger phrase
> comes at the end of it, that is, hanging from the rightmost branch. That
> means that when the reader has to handle the complicated phrase, her work in
> analyzing all the other phrases is done, and she can concentrate her mental
> energy on that one.
* Example of a left-branching tree (p 142):
> "English is predominantly a right-branching language (unlike, say, Japanese
> or Turkish), so right-branching trees come naturally to its writers...The
> full English menu, though, offers them a few left-branching options.
> A modifier phrase can be moved to the beginning, as in the sentence _In
> Sophocles' play, Oedipus married his mother._...As long as the modifier is
> short, it poses no difficulty for the reader. But if it starts to get longer
> it can force a reader to entertain a complicated qualification before she has
> any idea what it is qualifying."
* Dr Suess example of a left-branching tree converted to a right-branching tree (p 145):
> My favorite explanation of the difference in difficulty between flat,
> right-branching, and left-branching trees comes from Dr. Seuss’s Fox in
> Socks, who takes a flat clause with three branches, each containing a short
> right-branching clause, and recasts it as a single left-branching noun
> phrase: “When beetles fight these battles in a bottle with their paddles and
> the bottle’s on a poodle and the poodle’s eating noodles, they call this
> a muddle puddle tweetle poodle beetle noodle bottle paddle battle.”
* Center-embedded trees (p 145-6):
> As much of a battle as left-branching structures can be, they are nowhere
> near as muddled as center-embedded trees, those in which a phrase is jammed
> into the middle of a larger phrase rather than fastened to its left or right
> edge...
>
> Though I’m sure you can follow an explanation on why the string _Leave Leave
> Leave Your Language Alone Alone Alone_ has a well-formed tree, you could never
> recover it from the string. The brain’s sentence parser starts to thrash when
> faced with the successive leaves at the beginning, and it crashes altogether
> when it gets to the pile of alones at the end.
* "Splitting in two (or three or four) is often the best way to tame a sentence that has grown unruly." (p 149)
* Tortuous syntax is the syntactic version of the curse of knowledge (p 149):
> How does a writer manage to turn out such tortuous syntax? It happens when he
> shovels phrase after phrase onto the page in the order in which each one
> occurs to him. The problem is that the order in which thoughts occur to the
> writer is different from the order in which they are easily recovered by
> a reader. It’s a syntactic version of the curse of knowledge.
* Read the sentence aloud (p 149):
> In chapter 3 I mentioned two ways to improve your prose—showing a draft to
> someone else, and revisiting it after some time has passed—and both can allow
> you to catch labyrinthine syntax before inflicting it on your readers.
> There’s a third time-honored trick: read the sentence aloud.
* The challenge of holding right branching trees in memory (p 150):
> Earlier I mentioned that holding the branches of a tree in memory is one of
> the two cognitive challenges in parsing a sentence. The other is growing the
> right branches, that is, inferring how the words are supposed to join up in
> phrases. Words don’t come with labels like “I’m a noun” or “I’m a verb.” Nor
> is the boundary where one phrase leaves off and the next one begins marked on
> the page. The reader has to guess, and it’s up to the writer to ensure that
> the guesses are correct. They aren’t always.
* Syntactic ambiguity (p 151):
> In the simpler case of lexical ambiguity, an individual word has two
> meanings, as in the headlines SAFETY EXPERTS SAY SCHOOL BUS PASSENGERS SHOULD
> BE BELTED and NEW VACCINE MAY CONTAIN RABIES. __In syntactic ambiguity, there
> may be no single word that is ambiguous, but the words can be interconnected
> into more than one tree.__
* Garden paths (p 154):
> [F]or every ambiguity that yields a coherent (but unintended)
> interpretation of the whole sentence, there must be thousands which trip up
> the reader momentarily, forcing her to backtrack and re-parse a few words.
> Psycholinguists call these local ambiguities “garden paths,” from the
> expression “to lead someone up the garden path,” that is, to mislead him...
>
> Most garden paths in everyday writing, unlike the ones in textbooks, don’t
> bring the reader to a complete standstill; they just delay her for a fraction
> of a second...
>
> Garden paths can turn the experience of reading from an effortless glide
> through a sentence to a tedious two-step of little backtracks.
* __Prosody__ as a way to avoid garden paths (p 155):
> Prosody. Most garden paths exist only on the printed page. In speech, the
> prosody of a sentence (its melody, rhythm, and pausing) eliminates any
> possibility of the hearer taking a wrong turn...That’s one of the reasons
> __a writer should mutter, mumble, or orate a draft of his prose to himself,
> ideally after enough time has elapsed that it is no longer familiar__. He may
> find himself trapped in his own garden paths.
* __Punctuation__ as a way to avoid garden paths (p 155):
> A second obvious way to avoid garden paths is to punctuate a sentence
> properly. Punctuation, together with other graphical indicators such as
> italics, capitalization, and spacing, developed over the history of printed
> language to do two things. One is to provide the reader with hints about
> prosody, thus bringing writing a bit closer to speech. The other is to
> provide her with hints about the major divisions of the sentence into
> phrases, thus eliminating some of the ambiguity in how to build the tree.
* __Words that signal syntactic structure__ as a way to avoid garden paths (p 157-9):
>  _Words that signal syntactic structure._ Another way to prevent garden paths is
>  to give some respect to the apparently needless little words which don’t
>  contribute much to the meaning of a sentence and are in danger of ending up
>  on the cutting-room floor, but which can earn their keep by marking the
>  beginnings of phrases. Foremost among them are the subordinator _that_ and
>  relative pronouns like _which_ and _who_...In some phrases, these are “needless
>  words” that can be deleted...The deletions are tempting to a writer because
>  they tighten up a sentence’s rhythm and avoid the ugly sibilance of _which_.
>  But if the _which_-hunt is prosecuted too zealously, it may leave behind
>  a garden path...
>
>  Oddly enough, one of the most easily overlooked disambiguating words in
>  English is the most frequent word in the language: the lowly definite article
>  _the_. The meaning of _the_ is not easy to state (we’ll get to it in the next
>  chapter), but it could not be a clearer marker of syntax: when a reader
>  encounters it, she has indubitably entered a noun phrase. The definite
>  article can be omitted before many nouns, but the result can feel
>  claustrophobic, as if noun phrases keep bumping into you without warning...
>
>  Though academic prose is often stuffed with needless words, there is also
>  a suffocating style of technical writing in which the little words like _the_,
>  _are_, and _that_ have been squeezed out. Restoring them gives the reader some
>  breathing space, because the words guide her into the appropriate phrase and
>  she can attend to the meaning of the content words without simultaneously
>  having to figure out what kind of phrase she is in...
* __Frequent strings and sense__: Many word combinations go naturally together
  (e.g. "cotton clothing") and when used together help lubricate a sentence. (p 159)
* __Structural parallelism__: Phrases with the same structure used one after
  the can make ideas flow; e.g. "We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the
  landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall
  fight on the hills; we shall never surrender." (p 160-3)
* __Attachment to the phrase next door__ (p 163-5):
> When given a choice, readers tend to attach phrases lower in the tree rather
> than higher. Another way of putting it is that they like to absorb words into
> the phrase they are working on for as long they can, rather than closing off
> the phrase and figuring out somewhere else to place the incoming words...
>
> Many authors of stylebooks, such as Strunk and White, try to protect writers
> against this accidental hilarity with the advice to “keep related words
> together.” Unfortunately, the advice is unhelpful because it is stated in
> terms of strings rather than trees. In a panel on sex with four professors,
> trying to keep related words together won’t help: they already are together.
> The mischievous phrase on sex is smack-dab next to the related phrase a panel
> on the left, where it belongs—but it’s also smack-dab next to the unrelated
> phrase four professors on the right, where it doesn’t. What the writer has to
> worry about is connectedness in the tree (a panel on sex versus sex with four
> professors), not just adjacency in the string...
>
> The advice is better stated as “__pull unrelated (but mutually attracted)
> phrases apart__.”...
>
> Writers need to look in both directions, and shunt phrases around to keep
> them from dangerous liaisons with an inappropriate next-door neighbor.
* __Save the heaviest for last__ (p 166): "another version of the advice to
  prefer right-branching trees over left-branching and center-embedded ones."
* __Topic, then comment. Given then new.__ (p 167): "Once again, it’s good cognitive
  psychology: people learn by integrating new information into their existing
  web of knowledge."
* __The passive voice can sometimes help rearrange a sentence so it has better flow.__ (p 168-172)
