# Python Community; 2022-05
* What are best resources for getting involved with the Python community?

# Mailing Lists
* python.org [Mailing Lists](https://www.python.org/community/lists/)
* Announcements: [python-announce-list](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-announce-list@python.org/)
* Popular user list: [python-list](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/)
* Main development list, for the language itself: [Python-Dev](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-dev@python.org/)

# Python Software Foundation
* Wikipedia [Python Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Software_Foundation)
* python.org [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/)
* pyfound.blogspot.com [Python Software Foundation News](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/)
* twitter.com [Python Software Foundation](https://twitter.com/ThePSF)

# Python Steering Council
* github.com/python [steering-council](https://github.com/python/steering-council): "Communications from the Steering Council"
* discuss.python.org [2022 Python Steering Council Election Results](https://discuss.python.org/t/2022-python-steering-council-election-results/12581) (2021-12-01)
* [PEP 8016 â€“ The Steering Council Model](https://peps.python.org/pep-8016/)

# Forums
* discuss.python.org [Discussions on Python.org](https://discuss.python.org/)
* Look for red square icon under post title to see what category a post is in.
* Example categories:
  * [Packaging](https://discuss.python.org/c/packaging/)
  * [Users](https://discuss.python.org/c/users/)
* Platform is Discourse.
* Wikipedia [Discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_(software)):
  * "is a free and open-source Internet forum software. Features include
    support for categorization and tagging of discussions, configurable access
    control as well as usability improvements recently popularized by large
    social networks, such as live updates, expanding link previews, infinite
    scrolling, and real-time notifications."
  * Written in Ruby and JavaScript.
* lwn.net [Leaving python-dev behind](https://lwn.net/Articles/901744/) (2022-07-20):
  * "It was not all that long ago that Python began its
    [experiment](https://lwn.net/Articles/768487/) with replacing one of its
    mailing lists with a forum on its [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)
    discussion site. Over time, the Discourse instance has become more and more
    popular within the Python community. It would seem that another mailing
    list will soon be subsumed within Discourse as 
    __the Python steering council is planning to effectively retire the venerable python-dev mailing list soon__"
  * "These days, the [python-committers list](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-committers@python.org/)
    still exists, but it mostly receives announcements and the like; some
    discussions still take place there, but most, it would seem, are done on
    the Discourse site. There are plenty of other forums on that site,
    including two that overlap the main mailing lists where development
    discussions take place.  The 
    [Core Development forum](https://discuss.python.org/c/core-dev/23) overlaps
    the function of the python-dev mailing list, while the 
    [Ideas forum](https://discuss.python.org/c/ideas/6) serves the same purpose
    as the python-ideas mailing list."

  * "You have come to the right place to learn everything you need to create,
    deploy and operate Python-powered applications. Full Stack Python is an
    open source book that explains technical concepts in plain language."
  * Looks like a great resource for learning about all sorts of Python related
    topics, and full-stack development in general.
